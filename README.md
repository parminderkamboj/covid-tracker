# covid-tracker
A simple react native app to track corona virus and my own learning. WIP...
Special thanks to the folks at 
https://wuhan-coronavirus-api.laeyoung.endpoint.ainize.ai/jhu-edu for their free and wonderful API for live traffic.
//TODO rest of the two screens need to be hooked to APIs, test coverage and refactoring.
